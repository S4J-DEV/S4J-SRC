# About SearchForJohn

SearchForJohn is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

## Suggested Sites/Softwares.

- [NextDNS] protects you from all kinds of security threats, blocks ads and trackers on websites and in apps and provides a safe and supervised Internet for kids â€” on all devices and on all networks. (And if you use my link, I get a kick-back!)

- [LibRedirect] is a software I personally suggest test out as it allows for redirecting popular/crontrivercial platforms to alternitive [FOSS]/[Libre] frontends that typically respect users privacy to a higher degree.

- More To Come, (Maybe)

## Make SearchForJohn better.

- You can now find me on [BlueSky], feel free to follow me or reach out!

- Please consider donating to this project using the [Donate] link!

## Why use it?

- SearchForJohn may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- SearchForJohn doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- SearchForJohn is and always will be free.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, feel free to make SearchForJohn your default search engine!


## How do I set it as the default search engine?

SearchForJohn supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]

- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.

- [Chromium]- based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

## How does it work?

SearchForJohn is a fork of the well-known [SearXNG] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  SearchForJohn
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.
